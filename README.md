# NLP-Preprocessing-And-Text-Classification
# 🧠 NLP Text Classification Assignment

## 📌 Objective

The primary objective of this assignment is to apply **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to preprocess text data and build a machine learning model for **text classification**.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

By completing this assignment, you will be able to:

- Apply common NLP preprocessing techniques:
  - Tokenization
  - Stopword Removal
  - Stemming
  - Lemmatization

- Perform text vectorization using:
  - **CountVectorizer**
  - **TF-IDF Vectorizer**

- Build and train a **text classification model** using machine learning algorithms.

- Evaluate model performance using suitable metrics such as:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- Python
- Google Colab
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK / spaCy
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
